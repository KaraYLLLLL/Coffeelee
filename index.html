                                        <p>Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans.</br>
                                        Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.</br>
                                        It is the most popular hot drink in the world. Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans.</p>

                                        <p>This is a section of our team. Of course, not all of our employees are here, but these are the most important</br>
                                            ones above the others. We are all one and a friendly team, which at any moment can support another.</br>
                                            We have been working for more than 3 years, so we understand that you need to always work</br>
                                            We "Coffeelee" started our little world of coffee as soon as we smelled the aroma of coffee,</br>
                                            some at 12 and some at 20. We never want to stop at the beginning of creating our small but very cute socialization.</br>
                                            We are waiting for a lot of our own, native "coffee men", and you in person!:)</p></br>

                                        We will check lead times, verify packaging of items, identify any delivery challenges, check for potential cost savings in shipping, etc.</br> 
                                        If there are any issues or savings available, we will let you know by email prior to processing.</br> 
                                        Step 6 - Once the order is ready to go, we will process the the payment. Now your order is officially processed.</br> 
                                        Step 7 - Our warehouse will start to prep the items for whichever delivery method your have chosen.</br> 
                                        Standard FEDEX Ground Shipping: We will inspect the packaging and make sure that it is in perfect condition.</br>  
                                        We have FEDEX literally down the street, so as soon as it is ready, we will either drop it off or schedule a pick-up. Either way we will provide you with a tracking number at that time.</br> 
                                        Standard Large Item Shipping or Premium White Glove Delivery:</br> 
                                        We will inspect the packaging and make sure that it is in perfect condition. We will pack the item for common carrier shipping and schedule a pick-up. Once the item is scheduled for pick-up, will provide you with a tracking number.</br> 
                                        Step 8 - Once you receive your items, please inspect them thoroughly. Damages must be reported immediately.</br>  
                                        For more about shipping and returns, please read our shipping & returns policy.</br> 
                                        Step 9 - Enjoy your new pieces</br>

                                        However, we also realize that hiccups can happen along the way. Either way, please let us know how we did and how we can improve.</br> </p>

                        <h1>Why do you need to register</h1></br>
                        <p> 1.  Save time
                            Regardless of how potential participants register for your courses today, you will be able to save a considerable amount of time by using a registration system.</br> 
                            Cut down the time spent on tedious, manual processes, countless documents and systems by gathering all registrations and participant information in one place.</br>
                            Also save time on updates of your own website through a few simple clicks in the sign-up system that feeds directly to the website.</br>
                            </br> 2.  Easy administration of participants.</br>
                            With a complete registration system, you not only get sign-ups and participant information in a collective and neat portal, but you also get the opportunity to follow up the participants throughout the process.</br> 
                            If the registration system offers participant administration, you can follow up on the participants’ status (registered, cancelled, waitlisted, etc.), be able to see who has/has not paid, register attendance and perform all administrative work related to the participants in the same system.</br>
                        </br> 3.  Improve efficiency and increase value creation.</br>
                            The time you save by using a registration solution can be spent on other, value-creating tasks.</br> 
                            Get the opportunity to improve the quality and breadth of your training portfolio.</br>
                        </br> 4. Customise the training calendar and registration form to suit your website.</br>
                            A supplier of a good online registration system allows you to design and customize a clear calendar with conversion-optimal registration forms on your own website.</br> 
                            Customise both the course calendar and the registration form, so that it gets the look and feel you want in order to attract participants.</p>
